# Alpha Fitness

My second Android App, written for a Mobile App Development class at SJSU (Fall, 2016). 
This uses MPAndroidChart to draw a chart, and Google App APIs to display current location and path in a map. 

When the phone is held vertically, you can start & stop workout by clicking on the button. 
Once workout is started, it keeps track of your locations and draw the path you have walked/run.

When you click on the profile image, you can enter your personal information. 
This screen also shows the current workout statistics (lifetime and this week's average).

When the phone is held horizontally during the workout, it shows the live graph of calories burned every 5 minutes, till Stop button is pressed.
